This package provides a series of functions to deal with
conversion and transformations of coordinates in the Datum Austria

[http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datum_Austria](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datum_Austria)

and here specifically of the Bundesmeldenetz, the former federal cartographic datum
of Austria. The Bundesmeldenetz is already widely replaced by UTM coordinates but much legacy
data is still encoded in BMN coordinates. Unlike UTM, the BMN uses the Bessel reference ellipsoid
and uses lat0 at Hierro (canary islands), which makes transformations tedious.
