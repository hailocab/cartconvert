This package provides functions to deal with conversion and transformations of coordinates
of the OSGB36 datum, the UK National Grid.

The conversion between WGS84 and OSGB36 uses a simple helmert transformation,
which in the case of OSGB36 inconsistencies, may result in an accuracy not exceeding +/- 5m, and
for cornercases worse than +/- 15m.

If a higher accuracy is required, a set of helmert parameters must be used or the
procedure described at http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/gps/docs/Geomatics_world.pdf.

For further info see [http://gps.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/etrs89geo_natgrid.asp](http://gps.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/etrs89geo_natgrid.asp)

Usage is covered by test cases. For installation and further info navigate to the parent package.
